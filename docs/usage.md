# Usage

The README covers the basics. This page collects the
longer examples and the notes that did not fit up front.

## Basic

curl localhost:8000/v1/chat \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt": "hello", "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}'
```

## Notes

- POST /v1/chat with prompt/model/max_tokens
- SHA-256 keyed in-memory response cache
